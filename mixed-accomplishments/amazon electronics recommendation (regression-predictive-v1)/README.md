<div id="bg">Structuring PREDICTIVE MODELLING project</div>
<p>This to demonstrate how our system works, we used RapidMiner to analyze real retail data and generate those algorithms involving association analysis, product recommender and brand-level forecasting for sellers to refer to descriptive and predictive analytics. Especially in retailing present an algorithm to discover large itemset patterns for the market basket analysis in this FP- growth subject. There are a few interesting variables that obtained from the per week amount, brand category and product category and can be associated with alternative characteristics of forecasting methods which, in our view, allow to draw meaningful conclusions. Besides in this project, we are able to perform an empirical comparison of content-based filtering on data set, and we also compare them with other popular context-aware collaborative filtering algorithms. For each to evaluate regression and ARIMA models, we propose new evaluation metrics specific to Box-Jenkin approach can be investigated through the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).</p>
